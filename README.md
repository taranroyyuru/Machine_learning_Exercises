# Machine Learning Exercises

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Exercises** repository! Here youâ€™ll find my daily practice of core ML concepts, implemented end-to-end in Jupyter notebooks and supporting files. Each folder or notebook corresponds to a topicâ€”from linear regression and clustering to decision trees and cross-validationâ€”where I take what Iâ€™ve learned from videos, readings, and courses, and turn theory into hands-on tutorials and experiments.

## ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- **Tutorial Notebooks**  
  Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks that walk through:
  - Data loading & preprocessing  
  - Model training & evaluation  
  - Visualization of results  
  - Best practices for reproducibility (e.g. using `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`)

- **Topic Folders**  
  Organized by episode or concept (e.g. `Train_test_split_episode_7`, `Random_Forest_episode_11`), each containing:
  - `.ipynb` files with code and commentary  
  - Sample datasets (`.csv`)  
  - Serialized models (`.pkl` / `.joblib`)  
  - Any helper scripts

- **Supporting Data**  
  - `areas.csv`, `homeprices.csv`, `predictions.csv`, etc., used for hands-on exercises.  
  - Pickle/joblib files for model serialization and quick reloading.

## ðŸš€ How I Work

1. **Learn**  
   I watch video lectures, read blog posts or research papers, and take notes on new algorithms and techniques.

2. **Implement**  
   I translate theory into codeâ€”building a minimal working example in a Jupyter notebook, experimenting with hyperparameters, and visualizing performance.

3. **Refine**  
   I iterate: refactor code for clarity, add comments and markdown explanations, and clean up data pipelines.

4. **Document**  
   I write concise README sections, inline explanations, and commit messages so that readers (and my future self!) can follow along.
